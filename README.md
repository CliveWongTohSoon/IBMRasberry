# Getting Started
## Overview
This is a project done by penultimate year students from Imperial College London in collaboration with IBM to build a turn-based spaceship game that runs by voice commands. The followings are used to develop the game:

1. MEAN Application that runs on IBM cloud, read [here](https://github.com/kuzhankuixiong/IBMSocialGame/blob/master/README.md) to learn more about how to implement the MEAN Application on IBM Cloud.

2. Raspberry Pi 3 B+ that runs on Raspbian Stretch OS. Node.js is used to run IBM Watson Services, such as Speech to Text, Text to Speech, Watson Assistant, and is connected to MongoDB and MEAN Application on IBM Cloud.

3. PulseAudio is manually updated to version 11.0 (by default is version 10.0) so that it supports Bluetooth input and output from the Bluetooth earpods. 

## Tutorial
